# Speech_Emotion_Recognizer
Here I have built a speech emotion recognizer which is basically trained to detect the emotion expressed in different voices.

Here librosa and soundfile library is used for feature extraction from sound files
which are obtained from RAVDESS soundfiles dataset.

This speech emotion recognizer is built with the help of MLP classifier which helps in 
optimizing log-loss function. It is a feedforward ANN model which has its own internal
neural network.

With the help of this classifier, I am able to achieve an accuracy of almost 75%.
